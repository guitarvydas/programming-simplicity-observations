## An Abbreviated History of Programming Languages.

The ground truth is *programming*, not *coding*.

The goal of programming is to control a machine.

A secondary goal of programming is to make it possible to change a program easily, or, to steal parts of a program and use those parts in other programs.

A tertiary goal of programming is to buff and polish specific notations, like textual programming languages.  

Coding - writing textual scripts in a programming language - is but a subset of the main goal.  Buffing and polishing code notations is a sub-goal of programming, and is, therefore, not as important as the main goal: controlling a machine. 

## What is the point of programming?  
To control a machine.  

To accurately break down an action in steps so small that even a machine can perform the steps.   

Current electronic machines provide us with a set of potential steps that we are allowed to use.  

These potential steps are called "opcodes".
