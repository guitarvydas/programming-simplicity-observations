Switches were miniaturized down to the size of dust particles.[^zephyris]

### Drawback - Dust
The main drawback of miniaturization is that dust particles interfere with and block operation of switches when switches are that small.

The solution to this problem is to use clean rooms.  Clean rooms keep dust out when making very small switches.[^duk]

### Drawback - \$\$\$
The drawback of using clean rooms and miniaturization is that they are very expensive.

Only a few startups could afford to pay for clean rooms, e.g. Motorola, Fairchild, National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, Mitel, etc.
