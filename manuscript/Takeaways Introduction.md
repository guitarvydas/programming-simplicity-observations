What have we learned about programming?

This section is a survey of current programming techniques.

This section is a collection of essays about various programming technologies and languages that I've encountered over some 30 years of experience in delivering software and running a sofware consulting company.

I believe that it is important to understand existing technologies before embarking on improving any technique.

I have consciously tried to be terse, using point form in many cases.  Short is good, long is boring and TL;DR.  

Making a book shorter is harder than leaving it be long.

I've tried to keep the statement and discussion of every idea down to one written page.

This section is not arranged in any particular order.

The reader is welcome to visit sub-sections in random order.

I hope to inspire discussion and reflection about these obervations and I reserve the right to alter my views.
