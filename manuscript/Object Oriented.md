# Object Oriented

## Main Takeaway

- CASE on *type*

## Case on Type

OO performs - under the hood - a *case*[^oo1][^oo2] on the *type* (class) of an object.

[^oo1]: By *case* I mean choice, or, control flow

OO does not elucidate on the issue of *case* used for other purposes[^oo3].

[^oo2]: Bertrand Meyer pointed this out.

[^oo3]: Case on *data* is often called *flags* and *history*.  Case on *data* is constrained and regulated in a notation called StateCharts.
