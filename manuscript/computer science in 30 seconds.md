TBD, evolving, notes...

1. Grok
2. Fabricate
3. DRY

- why potzers get into trouble
- grok = parse
- fabricate = text manipulation, mathematical notation, report/code generation

# Grok
- understand the input, understand the current conditions
- pattern-matching
- parsing
- Ohm-JS
- YACC and descendants
- REGEX

# Fabricate
- REGEX
- JavaScript Template Strings
- Python f strings
- /bin/sh string syntax
- TCL
- compilers are transpilers
	- from strings of high-level language to strings of Assembler

# DRY
- "Don't Repeat Yourself"
- two methods:
	- adding options
	- nesting (like Russian Dolls)
- V7 Make vs. GNU Make
	- V7 Make manual is about 1 page (maybe 2)
	- GNU Make manual is about 200 pages
	- there is a difference between cookbooks and reference manuals

- features
- conditional compilation
- lambda wrappers, binding
- explicit parameters (Denotational Semantics)
- UNIX command-line tools (text manipulation)
- Microsoft Word Find-and-Replace (text manipulation)

- first cut at a project: clone a spreadsheet
- first cut at a project: clone a VB program and modify it


# Why Potzers Get Into Trouble
As a project grows larger and larger, scalability becomes an issue.

For scalability, you need:
- 0D
- DRY

## 0D
Zero Dependency.

- TBD, see elsewhere

# Options Are Bad, Simplicity Is Good 
- simplicity == "lack of nuance"
