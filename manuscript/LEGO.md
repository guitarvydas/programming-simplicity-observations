# Takeaways from LEGO速 Blocks

## Main Takeaways

- single, simple type for plugability

## API - Single, Simple Type

LEGO速 blocks employ a single, simple type for plugability - round pegs. 

Elaborate structures can be built up with LEGO速 blocks, despite the simplicity of the connecting type.

Choosing to use a very simple type for component interconnection does not mean that more elaborate type checking is impossible or ignored.  Types in programs *could* be built up in a layered manner, starting from very simple - LEGO速 pluggable types - to more complicated types.  

This pluggable approach is seen in Physics.  Pysicists define a simple set of *atoms*, then  build more-useful *molecules* using combinations of *atoms*.
