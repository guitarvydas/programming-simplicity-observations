# Lisp

## Main Takeaways

- High Level Assembler
- Programs That Write Programs

## Machine Readability vs. Human Readability

Machine readability allows automation.

Human readability tends to discourage automation.

## Lack of Syntax

Lisp has no syntax.

Lack of syntax is a desirable trait for machine readability.

## Expression Language

Lisp is an *expression language*.  

Every expression and every statement returns a value.

Lisp syntax is "normalized".

This feature - normalization - makes Lisp more machine-readable than most languages.

## Programs That Write Programs

Automation leads to programs that write programs.

Lisp macros are programs that write programs.

Normalization makes it easier to write programs that write programs.

Lisp's features favor normalization.
