## What Does "Reasoning About a Problem" Mean?

One of the original selling points of functional notation for programming was that it was supposed to allow "reasoning about programs".

The question arises "for whom?".

What seems like "reasoning" to mathematicians appears as a wall of unneccessary detail to others.

One answer is to apply layering.  

A notation can be invented for reasoning about programs at a deep mathematical level and other notations can be invented for other purposes.

For example, JavaScript satisfies many web designers, but JavaScript does not satisfy researchers and JavaScript does not satisfy spreadsheet users.  Alternatively, web designers nor spreadsheet users want to learn the intricacies of *monads*.
