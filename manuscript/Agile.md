# Agile

## Main Takeaway
- Stake-holders cannot (will not) specify *all* of the details of a problem.

## Anti-Takeway
- Sprints Are Too Long

## Goal of Agile

The goal of Agile is to deal with the uncertainty of the Design process.

Agile deals with design uncertainty by involving the stake holder(s) multiple times during the design process.

Most customers, stake-holders, cannot specify requirements with enough grueling detail to allow implementation.  Most customers, stake-holders, do not *want* to deal with *all* of the details.

Agile is a stop-gap measure applied to Design.  We continue to use Agile methods while hoping that better ways to perform Design with less uncertainty will be developed.

## Religion of Agile
Agile has become dogmatic - a religion.

Many programmers focus on the *rituals* of Agile, without addressing the *goals* of Agile.

## Sprints Are Too Long

2/3-week sprints are too long.

We should be striving for continuous improvement in the process of gathering requirements.

### 2 Hour Sprints 

We should be striving for 2-hour sprints.

### Redefining Sprints

We should be striving to change the concept of sprints into something even more productive.
