## Early Programming of Computers


### Tools
The earliest tools for programming computers were soldering Irons.

### IDEs
The earliest IDEs - Integrated Development Environments - for programming computers were soldering stations which included a desk, a static mat, soldering iron, solder, resin and optionally, amenities like magnifying glasses, desk lamps, etc.

### Process
Changing a program, consisted of unsoldering wires and connecting them elsewhere.

### Drawbacks
The primitive programming tools and IDE were slow, but, orders of magnitude faster than changing the behaviour of machines by pulling gears and replacing them with other gears.

Other drawbacks included blisters on fingers.  Recently soldered nodes would remain hot for a while and would create blisters if touched too soon.
