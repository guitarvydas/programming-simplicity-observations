# Tricky Uses of Paradigms - Tricky Code

## Anti-Takeaways from Tricky Uses of Paradigms 

- Tricky uses of a paradigm are a *tell* that the paradigm being used doesn't fit the problem-at-hand.

## Loops vs. Recursion

It has been discovered that Loops are a subset of Recursion.

Who cares?

Engineers and Implementors care.

Normal people don't care.

CEOs don't care.

Non-programmers don't care.

## Continuations

Continuations can be used to describe control-flow using the functional paradigm.

Who cares?

Normal people don't care.

## Thread Libraries

Thread libraries can be used to force-fit concurrency into the functional paradigm.

Who cares?

Normal people don't care.

Normal people use concurrency in their day-to-day lives, e.g. cooking recipes.

Architects need to capture concurrency requirements specified by "normal people" and need to translate such details into Engineering requirements.

## Layers

Ideally, there should not be a large gap between requirements specified by customers and details required at the Engineering levels.  

The flow of requirements from customers to Architects to Engineers to Implementors should contain a smooth flow of provenance.  Ideally, it should be possible to track customer requirements to their Implementation details.

If the mapping from customer requirements to Implementation cannot be performed in one smooth step, then a series of steps - layers - should be used.
